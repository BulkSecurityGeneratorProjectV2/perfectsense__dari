Query API
#########

Dari provides a database-abstraction API that lets you retrieve your data
models. Queries are represented by instances of the `Query`_ class. This
class should look very familiar to anybody that has used SQL before.

If you have Dari already installed, you can use the Code Tool to test out these
queries.

This documentation provides an overview of the most common methods used
to query objects in Dari.
