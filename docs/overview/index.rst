Overview

Roughly translated to "bridge" in Korean, "Dari" is the name of our data framework that powers the `Brightspot`_ digital experience platform. Dari provides data modeling and access features that are leveraged by Brightspot content and asset management applications. Dari was created at `PERFECT SENSE`_ to make data handling easier and more efficient for clients in a variety of industries.


Dari can be leveraged by any Java application that requires seamless database access and rapid evolution of data models. 
Unlike other data frameworks, Dari provides a comprehensive toolset that spans every aspect of how data flows throughout your application. Features include:

- Support for multiple databases. You can delegate to specific databases for specific needs, for example, Solr for text matching.

- Data modeling with standard Java types and simple annotations. With Dari, anything can be modeled and accessed with a web view or through an API. A data model can be altered by modifying the Java classes that define it. 

- Debugging tools, including diagrammatic views of data models, on-the-fly code compiling with immediate updates to the runtime environment, database and reindexing tools, and webpage metrics and Dari performance stats.

- Query API for retrieving objects from databases. 

- File Storage APIs for uploading and retrieving files on a local or remote storage location.

- Tasks system for creating and managing background threads.

Dari is open source and freely available for use under the BSD license.
