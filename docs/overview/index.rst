We believe that working with data, whether they're simple blog posts or
something much more complex, is the most critical part of building any
application. It's also the most difficult and frustrating, because the
current generation of data access frameworks don't do enough to provide
you with all the information necessary to let you be productive as
possible.

Dari was created at `PERFECT SENSE digital`_ to make our work in
handling data for a variety of clients in different industries easier
and more efficient. We wanted to create a comprehensive toolset that
spans every aspect of how data flows throughout your application.

This is the fruit of our work so far, and we wanted to share it with the
world. We hope you enjoy working with it as much as we do.
