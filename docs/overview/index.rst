Dari is a data access framework that powers Brightspot applications. 
Used to build complex content types and persist them to one or more SQL databases, Dari simplifies data handling, providing a single API to all databases and to local or remote storage.

Unlike other data frameworks, Dari is a comprehensive toolset that spans every aspect of how data flows throughout your application. Features include:

- Support for multiple databases. You can delegate to specific databases for specific needs, for example, Solr for text matching.

- Data modeling with standard Java types and simple annotations. With Dari, anything can be modeled and accessed with a web view or through an API. A data model can be altered by modifying the Java classes that define it, without regard to database schema or other configurations. 

- Debugging tools, including diagrammatic views of data models, on-the-fly code compiling with immediate updates to the runtime environment, database and reindexing tools, and webpage metrics and Dari performance stats.

- Query API for retrieving data models from databases. 

- File Storage tool for bulk movement of objects in CDN (Content Delivery Network) storage.

- Background tasks system for creating tasks, and a management tool for monitoring, starting, and stopping tasks.

Dari is open source and freely available for use under the BSD license.
